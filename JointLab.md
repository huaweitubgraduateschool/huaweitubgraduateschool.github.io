The JointLab is a collaborative hub between Technical University Berlin and Huawei. The main goal is establishing a worldwide leading site for research on AI-enabled IT Operations to empower resilient public, private, and edge cloud IT infrastructures for an autonomous world. We combine extensive industrial and academic experiences to identify and address the challenges arising in the operation of autonomous large scale IT systems.

Our mission is to:
1. Conduct impactful foundational **research:** in Big Data and Machine Learning for AI-enabled IT Operations to profoundly advance the state-of-the-art in managing IT infrastructures.
2. **Innovate** prototypical AI-enabled IT technologies for public, private, and edge clouds and support knowledge increase and tool availability to empower innovation in product development.
3. **Educate** via creation of courses and teaching materials for future academic and industrial careers as well as for life-long learning of business professionals.



Developing and deploying an AI-controlled loop
for Cloud Operations and Management
Considering software systems, networks, hardware and applications in private, public, and edge clouds
AI-enabled Operations (AIOps): The The most expensive part of future infrastructures is the cost use for system administrators. Environments get bigger, more complex, more heterogenous, so a lot of well-skilled administrators are needed 24/7 increasing the TCO significantly. Machine learning-based analysis of multiple sources of data (traces, logs, metrics) including pattern discovery, event correlation, clustering, and classification allows automated operation and maintenance of the systems at low cost without sacrificing R&D and innovation funding.
AI-driven CDNs: QoE and QoS are key parameters for CDNs which will become even more crucial for autonomous mobility, medical streaming services and other critical applications. The use of machine learning and AI enables proactive identification of failures, overload situations, increased cache misses, local resource bottlenecks, user mobility and behavior forecasting. Timely obtaining this knowledge allows variety of novel methods for adaptive content placement, LVS load balancing, caching optimization, latency and priority aware request handling.
Intelligent Data Center/Network Automation (Scheduling, Resource Management, Placement, NFV): Future cloud-based services must be reliable with respect to SLAs and TCO-minimized for the customer. Guaranteed SLAs need continuous service and fast reaction to problems. Anomaly detection (point 1) and fast recovery with intelligent scheduling, placement, and management of available resources is the key. On the other hand, the overhead cost for fault tolerance must be as low as possible to achieve attractive price for customers.
