We are happy to share the news that Prof. Dr. Odej Kao will participate in a panel discussion at Cloud Intelligence Workshop, collocated with International Conference on Software Engeenering (ICSE 2021). The topic of the discussion is "How to accelerate collaboration on Cloud Intelligence across academia and industry?" We are looking forward to the event.
