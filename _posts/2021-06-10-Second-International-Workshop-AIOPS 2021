Following our last year success with organizing [AIOPS 2020](https://aiopsworkshop.github.io/index.html),
this year the Joint Innovation Lab is organizing the "Second International Workshop on AIOPS" ([AIOPS 2021](https://aiops2021.github.io/)).
It will be collocated with the 19-th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing [ICSOC 2021](http://icsoc2021.josueonline.com/), in Dubai, UAE, November 22, 2021.
It is our greatest pleasure to have [Prof. Roberto Natella](http://wpage.unina.it/roberto.natella/) as Chair of the workshop.

The main focus of this workshop is to bring together researchers from both academia and industry to present their experiences,
results, and work in progress in this field. A major part of the workshop is to strengthen the community and
unite it towards the efforts for solving the main challenges.
