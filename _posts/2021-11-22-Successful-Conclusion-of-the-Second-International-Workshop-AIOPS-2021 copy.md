We held our AIOPs 2021 workshop on 22 November 2021. In the peak, we had 40 participants. 

Content-wise we had 8 submissions, 5 accepted papers, 22 senior PC members from 10+ countries. Industry parthners contributed papers as well. The workshop program was a little bit full, but we still managed to have time for questions and discussions.

We had two of the most prominent AIOPs researcher worldwide as speakers for keynote talk: Prof David Lo, Professor of Computer Science, and Director of the Information Systems and Technology cluster at Singapore Management University, and Qingwei Lin, from Microsoft Research Asia. They gave excellent talks and we are looking for ways to establish some kind of friendly association with our joint labs. We plan a follow-up event in September / October in Berlin or Munich. We will invite the participants, PC members + other relevant people from industry and academia to a 2-3 day summit to discuss current issues and plan joint initiatives.

All in all, we are very happy with the day, the workshop, the organization, and the outcome. More information here: official webpage of [AIOPS 2021](https://aiops2021.github.io/index.html).
