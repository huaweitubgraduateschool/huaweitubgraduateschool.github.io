We are very happy to announce that we are organizing a workshop on artificial intelligence for software development and IT operations on our beautiful university campus at Technical University Berlin. We aim at gathering researchers from academia and industry to present their experiences, results, and work in progress in this field. Auto-instrumentation, open telemetry, deep learning techniques for software coding, testing on the fly and many other trends impact the process of software development, verification, and operation.

Our goal is to spend three days discussing the challenges in our field and create a community roadmap with topics to look for, which can help us and our PhD students to find orientation and collaboration opportunities.

To enable a direct and fruitful discussion, we aim for a selected number of participants. We envision five rounds of discussions, three hours each, on topics determined beforehand via voting. For each topic, we will invite 2-3 short introductory presentations to set the scene for the follow-up discussion. The last session will be devoted to further open questions and the next steps.

The saloon is to take place at the begining of next year.
