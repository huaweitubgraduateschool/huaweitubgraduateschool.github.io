It is our greatest pleasure to annonuce the publication of our paper **First CE Matters: On the Importance of Long Term Properties on Memory Failure Prediction**  on the topic of memory failure prediction. In this paper
we studies the importance of considering the overall historical information when predicting DIMM failures. The evaluation is conducted on real world data. The paper is to be presented at IEEE Big Data in Osaka at the begining of December. Congratulations to the authors.
