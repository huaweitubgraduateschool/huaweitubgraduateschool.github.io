During the period of 05-15.12.2022, we presented the work of our lab at the groups of Prof Dr David Lo at the National University of Singapore and Prof. Dr Kensuke Fukuda at the National Institute for Informatics at Tokyo Japan. These were two very fruitful visits as we got to exchange ideas and feedback to one owns research. The Huawei-TUB Innovation Lab was represented by Bogatinovski Jasmin. He gave a talk on "Intelligent Log Analytics" which was recived with many questions and fruitful discussions. 

We are very excited to see and explore furthe ways on how to collaborate more.
