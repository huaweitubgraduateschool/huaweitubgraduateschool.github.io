Following the great success of the last workshops AIOPS 2020 (AIOPS 2020, videos, proceedings), and AIOPS 2021 ( AIOPS 2021, videos, proceedings), this workshop will be held as a part of the premier conference on data mining, ICDM 2023 in Shanghai from 01-04 of December 2023. Notably, the papers are to appear in a separate proceedings ICDMW, which is regarded as a high-quality publications and h-index of 25 as of SJR.

In continuation of the series of our prior successful workshops, we intend to organize the third workshop on artificial intelligence for software development and IT operations. We aim to gather researchers from academia and industry to present their experiences, results, and work in progress in this field. Of particular, but not limited, interest is the proposal of novel and adoption of existing data mining, machine learning and big data techniques for the emerging problems of auto-instrumentation, efficient utilization of open telemetry, techniques for software coding, testing on the fly, and building efficient visualizations. In this regard, our goal is to provide a venue for discussing the challenges in AIOps and create a community roadmap for responding to the most important challenges. To enable a direct and fruitful discussion, we aim for a selected number of publications through a rigorous peer-review procedure from renowned experts in the area. We strongly encourage the authors to adopt the principles of open science and reproducibility to boost research in this emerging area.
