We had an amazing 3 days discussing many AIOps related topics. The experience was overwhelmingly positive with many fruitful ideas and discussions. We had 15 inperson participants from 9 countries, 4 companies and additional 7 online participants. The profile of the presenters was quite diverse including Professors, Postdocs and PhD students. 
The main topics of discussion were: 1. Adopting Generative AI for AIOps; 2. Benchmarking and Reproducibility in AIOps; 3. Closing the gap between Academy and Industry. For more information please visit https://aiops2023.github.io/aiops2023/index.html.
