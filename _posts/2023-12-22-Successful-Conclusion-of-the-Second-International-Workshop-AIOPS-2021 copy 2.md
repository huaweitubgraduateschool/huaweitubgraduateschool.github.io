We held our AIOPs 2023 workshop on 04 December 2023. In the peak, we had 40 participants. It was great that the workshop took place in-person and we manged to reconnect with all the participants with whom in the last 4 years we patiently build a strong relationship in terms of collaboration, achiving the goal and purpose of the events of builidng strong AIOps research community. 

Content-wise we had 9 submissions, 5 accepted papers, 10+ senior PC members from 5+ countries. Industry parthners contributed papers as well. The workshop program was a little bit full, but we still managed to have time for questions and discussions.

All in all, we are very happy with the day, the workshop, the organization, and the outcome. More information here: official webpage of [AIOPS 2023](https://aiopsthirdworkshop.github.io/aiopsthirdworkshop/index.html).
