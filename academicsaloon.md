We are very happy to announce that we are organizing a workshop on artificial intelligence for software development and IT operations in our beautiful university campus at Technical University Berlin. We aim at gathering of researchers from academia and industry to present their experiences, results, and work in progress in this field. Auto-instrumentation, open telemetry, deep learning techniques for software coding, testing on the fly and many other trends impact the process of software development, verification, and operation.

Our goal is to spend three days discussing the challenges in our field and create a community roadmap with topics to look for, which can help us and our PhD students to find orientation and collaboration opportunities. We would be honored, if you could accept our invitation and be part of this discussion.

To enable a direct and fruitful discussion, we aim for a selected number of . We envision five rounds of discussions, three hours each, on topics determined beforehand via voting. For each topic, we will invite 2-3 short introductory presentations to set the scene for the follow-up discussion. The last session will be devoted to further open questions and next steps. A sponsorship by the Huawei Research Center is available to allow registration, meals, drinks as well as a social event free of charge. We can also support the hotel stay. The participants are expected to cover the cost of travel in Berlin.

If you are interested, so we kindly ask you to confirm your interest at [odej.kao@tu-berlin.de](odej.kao@tu-berlin.de). Depending on the responses from the community, we will decide shortly afterwards, if we have sufficient number of participants for a successful workshop.
