### 2024 / 2025 - CloudMap

CloudMap is a graph database and visualization platform developed by the Huawei Cloud SRE team. It stores all the topology relationships within the cloud infrastructure. The main objective of the project was to design an algorithm for root cause analysis using observation data from CloudMap.

As part of the project, a survey of related work in the field of metric-based root cause analysis was conducted. Based on this research, a metric-based RCA algorithm was designed to enable fast and precise localization of anomalies. Additionally, a proposal for incorporating a learning-based approach to root cause analysis for CloudMap was delivered.
